This is my version of the classic 2D game Tetris. The code is written in python and uses the Pygame package. The code uses a combination of 3 different classes as well as the built in sprite class for Pygame. The three classes are called Tetris, Tetrimino, and Tile. The game also includes a score counter, a reset button, and a display that showcases the next Tetrimino. I have included all of the images I used for the creation of my game. Understand that if you wish to run my code on your own system that you might need to change the file path of the images within my code.
